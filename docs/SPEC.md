# AffineRANSAC — Software Specification

> **Audience:** human developers and AI coding agents working on this repository.
> **Status:** Design spec, v0.1 (2026-09-30). No code exists yet.
> **Rule for agents:** Treat this document as the source of truth for intent and architecture.
> If the code has to deviate from it, update this document in the same change and record the
> reason in §12 (Decision Log). Unresolved items live in §13 (Open Questions). Do not silently
> guess answers to those; ask the user.
>
> **This spec is the long-term target, not a build list.** It describes swappable interfaces
> (`Feature`, `OverlapRegistration`, `TileMetadataReader`, the RANSAC model type) and
> configurable options (tile models, gauge choice, sub-pixel methods, MSAC scoring, etc.).
> **Do not build these up front.** Start with the simplest concrete implementation: plain
> functions and a single hard-wired method. Introduce an interface or option only when a
> second real implementation is actually needed. Follow the development approach in
> `CLAUDE.md`: small steps, each tested and easy for a human to review.

## 1. Purpose

Measure the **registration error** of photomask patterns. Registration error is the positional
deviation of each real, as-fabricated pattern from where the design says it should be.

The program:

1. Reads the **design** from an OASIS (`.oas`) layout file.
2. Reads a set of **SEM images** (JPEG) covering a large area as overlapping tiles, plus
   per-image metadata (stage position and pixel size).
3. Extracts pattern coordinates from both sources.
4. **Stitches** the SEM tiles into one common coordinate space. Contacts that appear in the
   overlap of adjacent tiles serve as tie points.
5. Calibrates the SEM coordinates with **Affine transforms**, fitted robustly with **RANSAC**
   so that erroneous patterns do not corrupt the calibration.
6. Compares the calibrated SEM coordinates with the design coordinates and reports per-pattern
   registration error, plus summary statistics.

### 1.1 Scope

| In scope (v1) | Future (design for it, don't build it) |
|---|---|
| Isolated **contact holes**, one (x, y) point per feature | **Line & space** patterns, which give a 1-D position constraint per feature |
| JPEG SEM images with stage coords + pixel size | Other image formats (TIFF/PNG, 16-bit) |
| Pluggable metadata reader (format still unknown) | Vendor-specific metadata parsers |
| Per-tile affine + global affine | Higher-order distortion models (polynomial intrafield) |
| Overlap stitching from matched contact coordinates | **Pixel-to-pixel (intensity-based) affine** registration of the overlap regions |
| Batch/CLI processing | GUI, interactive review |

---

## 2. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Design / layout** | Intended pattern geometry from the `.oas` file. |
| **Tile** | One SEM image (one field of view, FOV). |
| **Overlap** | Region imaged by two adjacent tiles. |
| **Feature** | A measurable pattern instance. In v1, a contact hole. |
| **Feature point** | The (x, y) position representing a feature, e.g. a centroid. |
| **Correspondence** | A pair of feature points believed to be the same physical feature (SEM↔design, or tile A↔tile B). |
| **Inlier / outlier** | A correspondence consistent / inconsistent with the RANSAC model, within threshold τ. |
| **Tile affine** `T_i` | Affine that maps tile *i*'s nominal stage coordinates into the common stitched frame. |
| **Global affine** `G` | Affine that maps the stitched frame onto the design frame. |
| **Registration error** | Residual `r = G(T_i(p)) − d` for SEM point *p* matched to design point *d*. |
| **Gauge freedom** | A transform that can be applied to all tiles without changing any overlap agreement, which makes it unobservable from overlaps alone. |

---

## 3. Coordinate Systems and Conventions

Getting coordinate conventions wrong is the most likely source of silent bugs. **All
conversions must go through one module (`geometry/frames.py`) and be unit-tested.**

| Frame | Origin / axes | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pixel** `(u, v)` | Image top-left, **v points down** | px | Pixel centres at integer coordinates (define and test this). |
| **Tile-local** `(x_t, y_t)` | Image centre, **y points up** | nm | `x_t = (u − u_c)·s_x`, `y_t = −(v − v_c)·s_y`, where `s` is the pixel size. |
| **Nominal stage** `(X, Y)` | SEM stage origin | nm | `(X, Y) = R_stage · (x_t, y_t) + (X_i, Y_i)`. `R_stage` is a configurable orientation (rotation/flip) between the image axes and the stage axes. |
| **Stitched** | Same as nominal stage after the tile affines are applied | nm | Output of stitching. |
| **Design** | OASIS coordinates, **y up** | nm internally | Converted from database units (DBU) on load. |

Rules:
- Internal unit is **nanometres, float64**, everywhere. Convert at I/O boundaries only.
- Points are stored as `numpy.ndarray` of shape `(N, 2)`.
- Affines are stored as 3×3 homogeneous matrices (last row `[0, 0, 1]`), applied to column
  vectors: `p' = A @ [x, y, 1]ᵀ`.
- The image→stage orientation (`R_stage`, sign flips) and any stage→design offset are
  **configuration**, not hard-coded. They are unknown until the SEM metadata format is known.

---

## 4. Inputs

### 4.1 Design: OASIS files (one per SEM tile)
- **Each SEM image comes with its own small, pre-processed `.oas` file** covering that image.
  We do *not* read one large full-mask layout. The workload is therefore **many small files**
  (about 1,000 tiles × a few hundred contacts). Per-file overhead matters, not large-file
  tricks (see D11).
- Library: **KLayout Python module** (`pip install klayout`, `import klayout.db`), which is the
  reference open-source OASIS implementation. All library use stays inside `io/design.py`, so
  it can be swapped for `gdstk` (Boost licence) if our code is ever shared (D11).
- Pipeline entry point: `read_contacts()` (centres + sizes). `read_polygons()` is for the
  viewer only, because extracting every vertex is ~6× slower.
- Config selects the **top cell** and **layer/datatype**.
- Hierarchy (cell references, arrays) is flattened.
- For contact holes: each polygon → one design feature point = **polygon centroid**. Also keep
  the bounding size (w, h) for classification and matching sanity checks.
- Output: a `DesignFeatures` table with `id, x, y, w, h, kind`.

### 4.2 SEM images: JPEG
- 8-bit grayscale (convert RGB to grayscale if needed). JPEG is **lossy**. Block artifacts can
  bias sub-pixel centroids slightly. Note this in reports. If the SEM can export PNG/TIFF,
  prefer that later.
- SEM images often have an **info/data bar** (scale bar, text). Crop it using a configurable
  crop rectangle, or auto-detect it.
- Loader: `opencv-python` or `imageio`. Grayscale images are returned as `float32` arrays.

### 4.3 SEM metadata
Needed per tile: **stage position (X_i, Y_i)** and **pixel size (s_x, s_y)**. Also useful if
available: FOV, magnification, scan rotation, timestamp, tile row/col.

The file format is **not yet known** (§13). Define an abstract interface:

```text
class TileMetadataReader(Protocol):
    def read(self, image_path) -> TileMetadata
TileMetadata: image_path, stage_x_nm, stage_y_nm, pixel_size_x_nm, pixel_size_y_nm,
              image_shape, (optional) scan_rotation_deg, row, col, extra: dict
```

v1 ships a **CSV manifest reader** (one row per image), so development and testing can
proceed before the vendor format is known. Vendor readers are added later as new
implementations.

### 4.4 Configuration
One YAML/TOML config file holds all tunables (layer, ROI, crop, detection parameters, RANSAC
thresholds, model choices, output paths). No magic numbers in code. Every run writes the
resolved config to its output folder for reproducibility.

Each stage is a pure function (plain data in, plain data out) and can be run and tested in
isolation. Intermediate results can be dumped for debugging (§9).

---

## 6. Stage Details

### S1 — Design loading
See §4.1. Build a **KD-tree** (`scipy.spatial.cKDTree`) over the design points for fast
matching.

### S2 — SEM feature extraction (contact holes)
1. Crop the data bar. Optionally denoise (Gaussian or median, configurable σ).
2. Detect candidates: threshold (Otsu or adaptive) + connected components, or
   blob/template matching. Contacts usually appear as dark discs with bright edges, but
   the polarity is configurable.
3. **Sub-pixel centre:** intensity-weighted centroid or ellipse fit to the edge contour. The
   method is configurable. This is the single most accuracy-critical step, so validate it on
   synthetic images with known centres.
4. Per-feature quality metrics: area, equivalent diameter, circularity, contrast, and
   distance to the image border.
5. Reject features that are **truncated by the image border** or fail the quality gates.
   Keep rejected features, flagged, for diagnostics.

Output per tile: `TileFeatures` with `id, u, v, quality…, flags`.

The feature abstraction must allow a future `LineEdgeFeature` (for line & space patterns),
which constrains only the position perpendicular to the line. Code in S4–S8 should depend on a
`Feature` interface, not assume "always a 2-D point". For v1, only the point implementation
exists.

### S3 — Nominal placement
Apply pixel → tile-local → nominal stage using the metadata and `R_stage` (§3). This is the
starting guess. Stage error is expected to be small relative to the pattern pitch (see the
matching constraint in S4/S6).

### S4 — Tile↔tile matching (overlap)
**Acquisition geometry:** tiles are acquired in **stripes**. Within a stripe, adjacent tiles
overlap in a thin strip at the top/bottom of the image. Once multiple stripes are measured,
adjacent stripes overlap in a thin strip at the left/right of the image. Each overlap strip
therefore contains only **a handful of contacts**.

**RANSAC is NOT used for stitching** (decision D8). With so few points per strip, a robust
sampling approach is meaningless. All matched tie points go straight into the least-squares
solve (S5). Bad tie points are prevented at the feature level instead: S2 quality gates,
especially rejecting contacts truncated by the image border. They are also *flagged* (not
removed) via their residuals after S5.

Overlap registration is a **pluggable strategy** (`OverlapRegistration` interface), which
yields tie points / pairwise constraints between tiles *i* and *j*:

- **v1: `FeatureOverlap`.** Uses contact coordinates.
  1. Collect the features of each tile that lie inside the overlap region (with a margin).
  2. **Coarse offset:** by default, nearest-neighbour matching in stage coordinates.
     Optionally refine it with image cross-correlation (phase correlation) of the overlap
     crops.
  3. **Correspondences:** mutual nearest neighbours within a gate radius `g`. These become the
     tie points for S5.
- **Future: `PixelOverlap`.** A pixel-to-pixel (intensity-based) affine registration of the
  two overlap crops, e.g. ECC maximisation (`cv2.findTransformECC` with `MOTION_AFFINE`) or a
  similar method. It uses the full image content rather than a few centroids, which matters
  when a strip contains too few contacts, or for patterns such as line & space. Its output (a
  pairwise affine plus uncertainty) is converted into equivalent constraints for S5, e.g.
  virtual tie points sampled over the overlap region.

S5 must consume the strategy's output without knowing which strategy produced it.

⚠ **Periodicity / aliasing:** contact arrays are periodic with pitch `P`. If the nominal
misplacement exceeds `P/2`, nearest-neighbour matching locks onto the wrong neighbour. All
matches are then off by exactly one pitch, and RANSAC cannot detect it because they are
mutually consistent. Requirements:
- The gate radius `g < P/2`.
- Stage error must be `< P/2`, **or** the coarse offset must come from something
  non-periodic: image correlation over an aperiodic region, a unique mark, or a pattern
  boundary.
- Log a warning when the matched fraction is low or the offset is close to `P/2`.

### S5 — Global stitching solve (per-tile affines)
Unknowns: one affine `T_i` per tile (6 parameters each). Observations: every tie point
`(p ∈ tile i, q ∈ tile j)` contributes `T_i(p) − T_j(q) = 0` (2 equations).

- Solve as one **sparse linear least-squares** problem (`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr`). Affines
  are linear in their parameters.
- **Gauge fixing (mandatory):** overlaps cannot observe a transform applied to *all* tiles.
  Fix it by constraining the **mean of the tile affines to equal identity**, i.e. the nominal
  calibration. Whatever common error remains is absorbed later by the global affine `G` (S7).
  Alternative: pin one reference tile. This is simpler, but it biases the solution towards
  that tile. Config option `gauge: mean | reference_tile`.
- Weighting: weight each observation by its feature-quality weight (optional).
- After solving, compute the per-tie residuals. Report them, and **flag** ties above a
  threshold as diagnostics. Do not remove them automatically (no RANSAC / outlier rejection in
  stitching, D8).

⚠ **Conditioning:** overlap strips are narrow, so a tile's scale and skew are weakly
determined by points confined to its edges. Errors can accumulate along long chains of
tiles. Mitigations, all configurable:
- `tile_model: affine | similarity | rigid | translation`. The default is `affine`, as
  requested. Check the rank and condition number and warn or fall back when a tile is
  under-constrained.
- `tile_model: shared_intrafield`. A single affine distortion common to all tiles (same SEM,
  same magnification) plus per-tile translation (and rotation). This is physically plausible
  and much better conditioned. Evaluate it against the per-tile affine using synthetic data
  (§10).
- Optional weak regularisation pulling each `T_i` towards identity.

Output: `T_i` for each tile, per-tile diagnostics (number of ties, RMS tie residual, condition
number) and the stitched coordinates of every SEM feature. When a feature appears in multiple
tiles, keep **all** observations. For comparison with the design, use their mean, and report
the spread as a stitching-quality metric.

### S6 — SEM↔design matching
1. Coarse alignment: stitched frame ≈ design frame, plus a configurable offset/orientation
   (from config or from an initial correlation). The same periodicity caveat as in S4 applies.
2. For each stitched SEM point, find the nearest design point (KD-tree). Accept it if the
   distance is `< g_design` (`< P/2`). Enforce **one-to-one** matching (mutual nearest, or the
   Hungarian algorithm for conflicts).
3. Unmatched SEM points: extra/spurious features. Unmatched design points inside the imaged
   area: missing features. Both are reported, never silently dropped.

### S7 — Global RANSAC affine (the core algorithm)
This implements the approach specified by the user:

1. Repeatedly draw **3 correspondences** at random (the minimal sample for a 2-D affine: 6
   unknowns, 6 equations).
2. Compute the **exact affine** mapping the 3 SEM points onto their 3 design points.
3. Apply it to **all** SEM points and count the **inliers**: correspondences whose residual is
   `< τ` (the RANSAC threshold, in nm).
4. Keep the 3-point model with the **most inliers**. Ties are broken by the lower sum of inlier
   residuals.
5. **Refit:** least-squares affine using **all inliers** of the best model → final global
   affine `G`. Optionally iterate: recompute the inliers with `G`, refit, and repeat until the
   inlier set is stable (max `k` iterations).
6. Apply `G` to **all** stitched SEM coordinates.

Details are in §7.

**Interpretation of inliers and outliers (user's intent):**
- **Inliers** are assumed to be correctly patterned features. The affine fitted to them, `G`,
  therefore estimates the SEM **measurement error** (calibration, stage, distortion) and
  nothing else.
- `G` is applied to **all** SEM points, inliers and outliers alike, correcting the measurement
  error everywhere.
- **Outliers** then show large residuals against the design, and those residuals are the
  indication of **mask defects / local registration errors**. Outliers are excluded from
  *fitting* `G` only. They must never be dropped from the transformed output or the report.

RANSAC is used **only here** (SEM↔design), not in stitching (D8).

### S8 — Registration error and reporting
- For every matched pair: `r = G(stitched SEM point) − design point` → `(dx, dy, |r|)`, plus
  the inlier/outlier flag, tile id(s) and quality metrics.
- **Reported registration error = residuals after the full affine is removed** (decision D4).
  The fitted affine terms are reported separately (§8.2), because linear mask errors (scale,
  rotation, orthogonality) are indistinguishable from SEM calibration errors and are absorbed
  into `G`.
- Summary stats (per axis and for inliers / all points): mean, σ, **3σ**, max |r|, count.
  Also per-tile stats.
- Viewers (interactive, **pyqtgraph**, D12): residual **vector map** (arrows scaled up),
  histograms of dx/dy, tile layout with tie quality, and the outlier locations.
- Outputs: CSV/Parquet of per-feature results, JSON summary (affine terms, stats, config,
  versions). Static images, if needed, are exported from the pyqtgraph views. The output format
  may change (§13).

## 7. RANSAC Specification

Module: `fitting/ransac.py`. It is used by S7 only. Keep it generic over the model type
(affine now; possibly others later) so that it can be tested independently.

| Parameter | Meaning | Default guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `threshold_nm` (τ) | Inlier residual cutoff | Roughly 3× the expected measurement noise (from synthetic tests / repeatability). Configurable. |
| `confidence` (p) | Target probability of drawing ≥1 all-inlier sample | 0.999 |
| `max_iters` | Hard cap | 10 000 |
| `min_inlier_ratio` | Fail/warn below this | configurable, e.g. 0.5 |
| `seed` | RNG seed | **Always set.** Runs must be reproducible. |
| `refine_iters` | Inlier-refit loops after the best model | 3 |

- **Adaptive iterations:** `N = log(1 − p) / log(1 − w^s)`, where `w` is the current best
  inlier ratio and `s = 3` is the sample size. Update `N` whenever a better model is found.
- **Degenerate samples:** reject triplets that are (near-)collinear or too close together, i.e.
  triangle area `< min_area` (relative to the point spread). They produce ill-conditioned
  affines. Prefer samples spread over the field. Optionally use stratified sampling across
  tiles/regions.
- **Exact solve:** a 6×6 linear system (or `cv2.getAffineTransform`). **Least-squares refit:**
  `numpy.linalg.lstsq` on the inlier set. Optionally apply Hartley-style normalisation
  (centre and scale the points) before solving, for numerical stability at mask-scale
  coordinates (µm–mm offsets with nm residuals).
- Returns: the model, the inlier mask, the residuals, the iteration count, and the best
  3-point sample indices (for traceability).
- The `pure 3-point inlier-count` scoring is the specified default. MSAC (truncated-quadratic
  scoring) may be offered as an option, but must not replace the default without a
  Decision Log entry.

## 8. Affine Model

### 8.1 Form
```
[x']   [a  b  tx] [x]
[y'] = [c  d  ty] [y]
[1 ]   [0  0  1 ] [1]
```

### 8.2 Decomposition for reporting (small-angle, mask-metrology style)
- Translation: `Tx = tx`, `Ty = ty` (nm)
- Magnification: `Mx = a − 1`, `My = d − 1` (report in ppm)
- Rotation terms: `Rx = c`, `Ry = −b` (µrad)
- **Rotation** `θ = (Rx + Ry)/2`, **Orthogonality / skew** `ω = Rx − Ry` (µrad)

Also provide an exact decomposition (polar/QR) for large transforms. The sign conventions above
must be tested with synthetic transforms of known rotation and scale.

Apply transforms relative to a **reference point** (e.g. the centroid of the design points in
the ROI), so that translation is not coupled to rotation/magnification about a distant origin.

for data records.

---

## 10. Validation Strategy (synthetic-first)

Real data and the metadata format are not available yet, so **build a synthetic data
generator early** and use it for all tests:

1. Generate a contact array layout (with configurable pitch, size and ROI). Write it as `.oas`
   via klayout, so the reader is tested end-to-end.
2. Inject **known mask registration errors**: random per-contact displacement, plus some
   large-error "defect" contacts, plus an optional linear mask error.
3. Render SEM tiles: a grid with overlap, per-tile **known affine distortion**, stage noise,
   blur, shot noise, edge contrast and JPEG compression. Include missing/extra features and
   truncated border features.
4. Write the metadata manifest.
5. Assertions:
   - Recovered tile affines ≈ injected ones, modulo gauge.
   - After the full pipeline, residuals ≈ injected per-contact errors, minus their affine
     component.
   - Injected defects are flagged as outliers but still reported.
   - RANSAC is reproducible with a fixed seed.
   - Periodicity trap: a stage error `> P/2` without an aperiodic coarse alignment triggers a
     warning or failure, never a silent wrong answer.

Unit tests are also required for: frame conversions (axis flips!), exact 3-point affine,
LSQ refit, decomposition signs, degenerate-sample rejection, and one-to-one matching.

---

## 11. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accuracy target:** TBD (§13). The target determines the sub-pixel method and noise model.
- **Scale:** it must handle hundreds to thousands of tiles and 10⁵–10⁶ contacts. Use vectorised
  numpy, KD-trees and a sparse stitching solve. Don't use Python loops over all points.
- **Reproducibility:** seeded RNG. The resolved config, package versions and input file hashes
  are written to the output.
- **Traceability:** every reported point can be traced back to its image file and pixel
  location.
- **Platform:** developed on Windows. Use `pathlib` and avoid shell-specific assumptions.

## 12. Decision Log

| # | Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | 2026-09-30 | v1 supports isolated contact holes only; the feature abstraction must allow line & space later. | User requirement. |
| D2 | 2026-09-30 | SEM images are JPEG; metadata gives stage coords + pixel size, format unknown → pluggable reader, CSV manifest first. | User answer. |
| D3 | 2026-09-30 | Transform structure: **per-tile affine** (stitching via overlaps) **+ one global affine** to design. | User choice. |
| D4 | 2026-09-30 | Reported registration error = **residuals after full affine removal**. Affine terms are reported separately. | User choice. Linear mask errors are not separable from SEM calibration errors. |
| D5 | 2026-09-30 | Global calibration uses RANSAC with a 3-point minimal sample and max inlier count, followed by an LSQ refit on the inliers. Outliers are excluded from fitting but still reported. | User-specified algorithm. |
| D6 | 2026-09-30 | Stitching gauge fixed by mean tile affine = identity (default). | Overlaps can't observe a common transform; `G` absorbs it. |
| D7 | 2026-09-30 | Internal units nm, float64; design frame y-up; affines are 3×3 homogeneous matrices. | Consistency. |
| D8 | 2026-09-30 | **No RANSAC in stitching.** Overlap tie points go directly into the LSQ solve. Bad ties are prevented by feature quality gates and flagged via residuals, not removed. | User decision. Overlap strips (top/bottom within a stripe, left/right between stripes) contain only a handful of contacts. |
| D9 | 2026-09-30 | Overlap registration is a pluggable strategy: v1 feature-based (contact coordinates); future pixel-to-pixel affine. | User requirement. Some patterns may need intensity-based overlap matching. |
| D10 | 2026-09-30 | Interfaces and options in this spec are the long-term target. Build the simplest concrete version first, and add an interface or option only when a second real implementation is needed. | User rule: never overengineer; small, reviewable steps. |
| D11 | 2026-09-30 | Keep **KLayout** for OASIS reading. Extract centres without per-vertex Python work (bounding-box/centroid per shape). | Benchmark with 1,000 small files × 400 contacts: KLayout ≈ gdstk ≈ 1.2 ms/file, so speed is not a differentiator, and reading ≪ SEM image processing.

## 13. Open Questions (ask the user; don't guess)

1. **Metadata format:** where are the stage coords and pixel size stored (JPEG EXIF/comment,
   sidecar `.txt`/`.xml`/`.csv`)? Which vendor/tool is used?
2. **Stage ↔ image orientation:** the sign of the stage axes relative to the image, scan
   rotation, and whether the stage coords refer to the image centre or a corner.
3. **Stage ↔ design relationship:** how are stage coordinates related to design coordinates
   (alignment marks, known offset)?
4. **Pattern geometry:** contact pitch and size vs. expected stage error. Is the array fully
   periodic, or are there aperiodic regions/marks for unambiguous coarse alignment?
5. **Tile geometry:** typical FOV, pixel size, overlap width (top/bottom and left/right),
   tiles per stripe, number of stripes, and the typical number of contacts per overlap strip.
6. **Accuracy target / expected noise:** e.g. required 3σ registration precision in nm. This
   sets τ and the sub-pixel method.
7. **Tile model conditioning:** is a full per-tile affine really needed, or would a
   shared-intrafield + per-tile rigid model be acceptable if it proves more stable on
   synthetic data?
8. **Output format** preferred by downstream tools (CSV columns, units, sign convention
   `SEM − design` vs `design − SEM`).
9. **Data bar:** do the JPEGs include an info bar that must be cropped? Is it always the same
   size?
10. **Per-tile `.oas` coordinate frame:** *Tentative (user to confirm):* **global mask
    coordinates**. If confirmed, each tile's design file gives its absolute position on the
    mask. That is a strong prior for placement and stitching, and it largely removes the
    periodicity/aliasing risk in S4/S6.
11. **Per-tile `.oas` extent:** *Tentative:* exactly the image FOV. Contacts in an overlap
    region appear in **both** neighbouring tiles' files, so the design IDs of the same physical
    contact must be matched across tiles, e.g. by identical global design coordinates.
12. **Pairing:** *Answered:* by a **file-naming convention** (exact convention TBD).
