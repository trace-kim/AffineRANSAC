# MaskReg changelog

What changed in MaskReg, the release app, per version. The rules for the version number and for the run-file
numbers `FORMAT` and `ANALYSIS` are in [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md), "Versions and run files" (D99); how to
release a version is in [`README.md`](README.md), "Releasing MaskReg".

Every change goes under **Unreleased** in the commit that makes it. Say when saved runs are affected:
- **Format N:** `FORMAT` went up; runs saved by older versions are analysed again when opened (kept as backups).
- **Analysis N:** `ANALYSIS` went up; runs saved by older versions are shown flagged as outdated, with an offer to
  analyse them again.

## Unreleased (will be 1.0.0)

First numbered version. Saved runs: format 3, analysis 1. Runs saved by earlier copies of MaskReg carry no version:
they open, flagged as outdated.

- *File → Folders...*: choose the folder of `maskreg.ini` and the folder where FTP downloads are kept (D96).
- *File → Open recent*: the last 10 folders (D97).
- Analysing a folder again keeps the run it replaces in `MaskReg_backups/` (the last 5); an interrupted save no
  longer leaves a damaged file (D98).
- Every run records the MaskReg version and analysis that made it, and opening a folder checks them (D99). A run
  saved by a newer MaskReg is never replaced by an older one without the user's restart.
- Everything before (SPEC D77–D95): Stitching and Registration tabs, FTP browser and download, autosave, contact
  size tab.
